in order to run the application you should paste API key in the OpenAiService.kt line 19(which is offered in the Entry exercise for the “Unhooked from the Smartphone” thesis)
then run the app in the virtual device : my app screen ->open instagram ->wait for the toast to go back to my application to give the permission for capture screenshot -> click start now in the toast -> go back to instagram ,wait for 10 seconds and check notification of LLM Result

bc i have problem with image format so cannot get corrected evaluation result but call the gpt api successfully
